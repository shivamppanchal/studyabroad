                    France officially the French Republic, is a sovereign country in Western Europe that
                  includes several overseas regions and territories. Metropolitan France extends from the Mediterranean
                  Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. It is one of
                  only three countries (with Morocco and Spain) to have both Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines. Due
                  to its shape, it is often referred to in French as “The Hexagon".

                  France remains a great power with significant cultural, economic, military, and political influence
                  in Europe and around the world. It has the world's fifth-largest military budget, third-largest
                  stockpile of nuclear weapons, and second-largest diplomatic corps. Due to its overseas regions and
                  territories throughout the world, France has the second-largest exclusive economic zone in the world.
                  France is a developed country and has the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and
                  seventh-largest by purchasing power parity. In terms of total household wealth, France is the
                  wealthiest nation in Europe and fourth in the world.

                      <p>The quality of the French higher education system is recognized around the world. Its wide
                        variety of institutions offers excellent opportunities for teaching and research in every
                        subject and at every level. After the USA and England, France is the country that attracts the
                        largest number of international students in the world. International students make up more than
                        15 percent of the students at French universities and more than 25 percent of France’s
                        prestigious Grandes Écoles'. The French system of higher education is distinguished by a
                        diversity of institutions, courses, organisational arrangements and admission requirements.

                        engineering) and schools of art and architecture.

                      <strong>Tuition Fees:</strong><br>
                      <p align="justify"> One major benefit which students studying in France will enjoy is the
                        country’s fee system. For the majority of courses at most universities you will have to pay
                        only <strong>181 Euros </strong> a year for a bachelors degree (there are exceptions
                        engineering courses tend to cost more), <strong>250Euros</strong> per year for a masters course
                        and <strong>380 Euros</strong> per year for a PhD.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        However, a number of universities have decided to add associated costs related to specific
                        services (e.g. for diplomas related to continuing learning and training). With these additional
                        costs, in some public universities the tuition fees can reach as far as EUR 2.000 per year.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Admission to “master universitari” and other specialisation courses also have much higher fees.
                        Doctoral students who receive a grant from the university do not pay fees, but non- grant
                        holders are required to pay the fees, which will vary again according to the university chosen.</p><br>

                      <strong>Living Cost:</strong><br>
                      <p align="justify">
                        Accommodation expenses in towns, specially private lodgings, vary from 300 to 600 Euros per
