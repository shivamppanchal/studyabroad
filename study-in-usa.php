                  The <strong>United States of America (USA or U.S.A.)</strong>, commonly referred to as the <strong>United
                    States (US or U.S.)</strong>, America, is a federal republic consisting of 50 states and a federal
                  district. The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada
                  and Mexico. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and
                  the Caribbean. At 3.71 million square miles (9.62 million km2) and with around 318 million people,
                  the United States is the world's third or fourth-largest country by total area and third-largest by
                  population. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product
                  of large-scale immigration from many countries. The geography and climate of the United States is
                  also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife.</p><br>

                <p>
                  The United States is a developed country and has the world's largest national economy. The economy is
                  fueled by an abundance of natural resources and high worker productivity.

                      <p>Studying in the United States has many advantages. There is a wide range of choices and
                        opportunities, and you should have all of the information you need to make a decision that is
                        right for you.
                      </p>
                      <p>The first level of higher education is undergraduate study; beyond an undergraduate degree a
                        student may choose to receive a graduate education, also known as postgraduate work.</p>

                     <br> <span style="color:#0066FF;"><strong>Under Graduation:</strong></span><br>
                      <p align="justify">
                        Students who have completed high school and would like to attend college or university must
                        attend what is referred to as an undergraduate school. These are schools that offer either a
                        two-year degree (called an associate degree) or a four-year degree (called a bachelors degree)
                        in a specific course of study. That course of study is called the major. While most schools
                        that offer a four-year degree will admit students who have not yet chosen a major, all students
                        are required to select (or declare) a major by their second year at school. Students who
                        complete an associate degree can continue their education at a four-year school and eventually
                        complete a bachelor degree.

                      </p><br>
                      <span style="color:#0066FF;"><strong>Graduation:</strong></span><br>
                      <p align="justify">
                        Students who have obtained a bachelor's degree can continue their education by pursuing one of
                        two types of degrees. The first is a Master's degree. This is usually a two-year degree that is
                        highly specialized in a specific field. Students are sometimes admitted to a master's degree
                        program only if they have a bachelor's degree in a closely related field. However, there are
                        many exceptions to this, such as with students who want to pursue a Master's in Business
                        Administration (MBA) degree. Students who want to advance their education even further in a
                        specific field can pursue a doctorate degree, also called a PhD. A PhD degree can take between
                        three and six years to complete, depending on the course of study chosen, the ability of the
                        student, and the thesis that the student has selected. The thesis is a very intensive research
                        paper that must be completed prior to earning the degree. It is always required of students
                        pursuing a PhD, and may sometimes be required of students pursuing a master's degree.
                      </p><br>
                      <p>
                        Traditionally these programs are undertaken on campus, however there is a growing number of
                        accredited online college degrees that are appearing for students from all around the world.
                        They can offer some fantastic benefits to international students.

                      <br>
                      <p>Additionally, some other non-degree options exist outside of the traditional university
                        setting which students should explore as another option.</p> <br>

                      <span style="color:#0066FF;"><strong>Requirements:</strong></span><br>
                      <p>A Bachelor degree with a 65% average or overseas equivalent is required for the Master of US
                        Studies.</p><br>
                      <p>Students without a credit average may be admitted to the Graduate Diploma or Graduate
                        Certificate. Applicants without a Bachelor degree may be considered for the Graduate
                        Certificate with three years full-time employment in a relevant field.</p>
                      <p>Students in the Graduate Certificate and Graduate Diploma courses may articulate into the
                        Master of US Studies. Students who complete the Master of US Studies may apply to do the
                        advanced degree.</p><br>
                      <p>
                        All internationally educated students whose native language is not English are required to
                        submit proof of English Language Proficiency regardless of citizenship and/or U.S. residency.

                        US Universities are either public or private institutions. Thus, public school tuition expenses
                        are based on nonresident costs which are less expensive than private universities. It differs
                        from university to university ranging from public cost $ 5000 a year to $ 30000 per annum for
                        private institutes. Whereas, living expenses come to around $10,000 a year.

                        studies. It even differs on account of the miscellaneous stream one goes for. Like, the average
                        total cost per year for an undergraduate in a science stream comes to around 14,730 Pound
                        Sterling while a postgraduate will have to bear the expense of 14,800 Pound Sterling in the

                        the application form before you begin. Most schools will require some or all of the following
                        documents: an application form that includes important information about you, certified copies
                        of all academic records (diplomas, transcripts, etc.) in both the original language and

                        require international applicants whose native language is not English to demonstrate their

                        new, Internet-based version of the TOEFL test (TOEFL iBT) is being introduced beginning in
                        2006. The TOEFL iBT score assesses speaking, listening, reading, and writing.</p><br>

                        Graduate Record Examination (GRE): The GRE test is required for students to enroll in master's
                        or doctoral programs in the arts, sciences, humanities, and engineering fields. It consists of
                        two independent tests, the General GRE and the Subject GRE. The General Test is a computer test
                        that measures verbal, quantitative, and analytical writing skills developed over a long period
                        of time and not necessarily related to a particular field of study. The Subject Tests are
                        designed to measure knowledge and understanding of subject matter related to graduate study in
                        specific fields and also to assess whether a student has the prerequisite background to
                        undertake graduate study in a particular field. Since most graduate departments within a
                        university establish their own entrance requirements, including tests, you should write
                        directly to the universities in which you are interested to find out whether the Subject GRE is
                        required and in which subject.</p><br>

                        test specific knowledge attained through college course-work or achievement in a particular
